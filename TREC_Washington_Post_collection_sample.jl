The company is flying the aircraft on Friday in the Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words Prime Air, and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane’s tail number — N1997A — is a prime number, a gimmick the company says is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have already been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon."},{"mime":"text/html","type":"sanitized_html","subtype":"paragraph","content":"Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sortation centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/07/28/amazon-scores-a-profit-for-the-fifth-consecutive-quarter/\">set to open 18 fulfillment centers</a>, or three times the number it opened in the same quarter in 2015. These retailer hopes these efforts will make it better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses."},{"bio":"Sarah Halzack is The Washington Post's national retail reporter.
